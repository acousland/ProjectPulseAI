                - Project current objectives and goals
                - What major milestones or tasks have been completed since our last status report? This will help me gauge the progress made and the pace of the project.

                - How would you rate the overall team's progress and collaboration? Are there any concerns about resource allocation or team dynamics that we should be aware of?
